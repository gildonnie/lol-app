Don't leash against this matchup we want to beat him to level 2 and crash the second wave into turret before the third one comes up. We also can trade hard level 1 with just a little bit of fury, try to avoid his 3rd q damage. Aatrox has really good trades and healing but if we can kill him in a single all in that is how we win. Try to set up your minion wave so that you are closer to your turret so you have plenty of room to allin the Aatrox, if Aatrox is close by his turret he can take short trades and disengage to his turret easily. Look for opportunities to burn Aatrox flash with ur ignite + ghost and even if you don't kill him, use the 90 second window where your ghost and ignite are back up to kill him while his flash is down. When going all in vs aatrox its extremely important that you look to dodge his W or if u don't dodge it immediately sidestep out of it, ways you can dodge is either side stepping or spinning onto him and ghosting thru him making it hard for him to hit you. If he lands his w, quickly get out then go back on him, if you have your spin up still when he hits w you can spin through it fully in time to stay on the allin.",

It is really important when laning vs ahri that you try to fight and beat her pre-6, otherwise you will be on the back foot for most of laning. Her poke is often too much to deal with even with your massive sustain. Dueling Ahri in mid-late game while her ult is up is next to impossible unless she is really far behind. An item you can build to counter ahri in the mid-late game is Maw of Malmortius. Using this item costs you DPS but can prevent you from being oneshot by her forcing her to use more of her mobility to deal damage to you. Often times with Maw you can spin on her and look to force her ult, then back off without using your own ult then you will have pressure for about a minute.",

When akali hits 6 be careful as she can straight up one shot you if you are too far in lane. Try to get the wave on your side and farm it out until you get some more levels post 6 laning phase. The key to winning against an akali at this point is to make her commit for you after using her defensive cooldowns where you have time to fight back. If you need to be able to fight Akali solo in the mid game build Maw of Malmortius, it will prevent her from one shotting you with her combo forcing her to commit harder to you which should give you more time to get damage back on her and potentially kill.

There can be spots to all in an anivia, but first you must get some good short trades into her where you force resources out of her. A good time to trade in this matchup is if she uses her q to farm and she is far up in lane where you can punish the Q cooldown. WARNING! Do not get baited by her egg, her egg is a 4 minute cooldown.

Darius with Q start is strong for early clear to get level 2 first, Darius with W start will look to take trades with you when you walk up for minions. Biggest thing to pay attention is they keystone + summoner spells. Ghost+Flash darius with conqueror has extremely good all in and if you are caught too far in the lane with a pull he can usually burn your summoners and then kill you as well. If this darius pulls you at a bad time for you, your best hope is to turn on him and all in and pray for crits. The darius matchup in general is a lot about punishing cooldowns on his q and finding spots to take short trades with an auto attack + spin out without being forced into an all in by being pulled. Tryndamere does outscale this matchup in the mid-late game 1v1, but can be hard to dive him 100-0 so if you find yourself in that situation where he is just sitting under turret, then push him in and look for opportunities to outrotate him with your superior out of combat mobility and flank his team.

Diana is mostly immobile so you can run her down the lane for an all in which you will win assuming you have a good amount of fury/hp. You counter diana's burst with your ultimate post 6, A good diana will try to burst you of your ultimate and then use her dash on a minion to kite you out so the best thing you can do is force her to commit all of her abilities into you to burn your ultimate. Dueling against Diana in the mid game is pretty easy as long as you dont miss your ultimate. Dueling her in the late game when she has the power to one shot you with items and then zhonya can make it pretty difficult on you.

Lethal + resolve (tenacity, unflinching, second wind) Ghost + Flash, or Ignite + Flash Fiora is a tough matchup early in the game especially if the fiora takes grasp of the undying or PTA as her keystone. Take trades with the position so when you attack her she has a hard time hitting your vital so be moving constantly (in between every auto). If you have a bad vital early (vital is directly in front of you where fiora can easily hit it) then you can reset the vital position by walking out of fiora's range, which is pretty far but usually can reset it atleast for the first minion wave. Fiora's W when it hits you will reduce 50% of your attack speed in a 1v1 so DO NOT commit onto her with your spin she will riposte, auto attack, e to reset her auto attack, then q your vital and disengage and there isnt much you can do about it. The only time spinning into Fiora while she has her W up is if you dodge it or if shes just so low that basically one auto kills her Fiora's W however has a REALLY long cooldown (24 seconds level 1) so if she uses it and doesnt get a good trade on you, then you need to look for a spot to trade with her (usually right after she q's.)When you want to dive Fiora try to attack her and burn her W, then spin out of turret range, then reengage the dive while her W is on cooldown. If fiora wastes her W and she does not all in you with it that is a great time to look for a trade/allin. When using your W just remember that she will turn her back towards you when she uses her riposte or if she wants to turn and slow you down with her e auto attack reset. Usually I will use my w when she q's away from me to disengage so that she is guaranteed facing away from me. In the mid-late game splitpush the 1v1 is pure skill on both sides. Tryndamere can hug a wall to prevent the 4 vitals from fiora's ultimate from being hit so that she doesnt get the healing, and fiora can angle to get the vitals before Tryndamere can hug a wall or fight Tryndamere when he is in the center of the lane.

Fizz's E has a 16 second cooldown level 1, so when its down you have a lot of time to work with to get an all in. When you trade and look for an allin do not start with your spin.

Look to farm up and sustain with second wind, revitalize, q, and dorans shield healing until you get enough damage to all in (usually post 6). Once you get enough damage you can start looking for aggressive trades into him. A big part of this matchup is playing around his barrels. One really good tip I have discovered from playing this matchup a lot is that gangplank will usually put down a barrel below him to disengage from you if you spin on him, but what you can do is walk inside the barrel range to bait him to try to auto or q it, then you walk right back out before it explodes. Taking out his barrels that way or straight up just walking up and hitting it before he does can help you significantly to win this matchup. In the mid-late game splitpush beating gangplank in a 1v1 is about how well you outplay him on his barrels when you are diving him. If you aren't playing well around his barrels, you can look to use your superior mobility out of combat to roam and flank his team after shoving him into his turret on the split.

Early game build up fury, and when you have a good amount of fury built up, look to auto attack him and move forward towards his escape path in between auto attacks and then spin on him after his silence is over and you can get an extra 2-3 auto attacks to win the trade. Don't use your W on Garen until he Q's because his Q takes away the move speed slow from your W. Post 6, be mindful of Garen's ultimate which is an execute based on your missing health. It has a very long cast animation though so you can usually wait to ult until you see the animation for his ult coming down (if you know you have bad reaction time to stuff u can just ult at like 25% or so). You can ult even if you are silenced so dont worry about that. Another tip for laning phase is if you w and slow the garen it will stop his passive from healing him. If you w and dont hit the slow then it will not stop his healing. In the allin vs garen, make sure that you use your w after he uses his Q because his Q will cleanse your slow. In the mid-late game if garen built tanky it can be hard to dive him under turret so look to catch him away from his turret, or if he is playing really safe then shove him in and outrotate him with your superior mobility.

Once gnar hits level 3 if you havent gotten enough damage on him to look for a kill then just farm. IMPORTANT NOTE: Gnar's hop is a 22 second cooldown level 1.

The key to this matchup is to look for solid trades where his q isnt stacked up and then dip out before he gets it stacked up all the way.

What I do is bait out her E (which has a 16 second cooldown level 1) by walking towards one of her tentacles and then preparing myself to move to the side the instant she throws out her E or even doing a stepback preemptively to dodge. When her E is down early you can crush illaoi. Post 6 with ignite you can beat illaoi even if she hits her E on you. As long as you dont take too much poke before you set up an all in you will crush illaoi. In the mid-late game split push she will almost always be able to burn your ulti early with her ulti but you can burst her down with ignite. Sometimes if she ults too early, you can just back off and wait until her ulti expires and then re-engage on illaoi with your ultimate advantage.",

        "WHAT TO DO": "Lethal Tempo Runes and Build. Ghost + Flash or Ignite + Flash. Long sword 3 potion start OR Dorans blade start if the irelia takes ignite. Tryndamere can beat irelia in allins early BUT you must be careful about her passive and conqueror/Lethal tempo. She stacks both very quickly and can burst you down and use your own minion wave to kite you. Levels 1 and 2 you can get a good advantage on her if she doesn't play back early on, but if the Irelia takes ignite she might try to get a quick 4 stack on the first 3 minions of the wave + you and all in (which is why you take dorans blade in that case). Look to sidestep her E when she casts it, if you dodge her E that can be a very good time to force a trade. Remember when forcing an extended trade early, do your best to start off the trade with an auto attack that way you can extend the trade with your spin to keep on top of her after she disengages. Some Irelia's will start e or w level 1 to get minions from range but if she uses her cooldown try to position yourself forward so that if she walks in your spin range after she used her ability you can get a good trade on her. Post 6 You will win every allin as long as you start the allin with close to full fury and 90% or more hp. A good tip against Irelia is to fight her away from your minion wave, Irelia cannot kite away from you if she doesn't have your minions to dash around. In the mid-late game splitpush you will win the 1v1's as long as you dont get kited too hard. What I like to do sometimes against Irelia is dive them 100-0 right after they have killed my minion wave so that they can't kite away. Her W is a 50% physical damage reduction channel but only lasts 2 seconds.",

Level 1 you want to look to make jax use counterstrike by walking up and auto attacking him, once jax has started using counterstrike make a quick move into his body then spin out to hit jax with your spin and get away from his counterstrike all in one. From there you have a window where if jax walks up he wont have counterstrike and you can potentially ghost on him for a huge trade and apply a ton of pressure. It is worth using ghost for a chunk of damage as tryndamere has much higher sustain. Look to shove jax in early then allow the wave to shove back to you, at level 3 jax becomes stronger than tryndamere but only if the tryndamere has allowed jax to stay relatively high hp. Always look to be short trading and bullying the jax early on. If you get caught up in a bad trade, look to let the wave shove and farm under turret. If you have an advantage in EXP, try to hit 6 before jax and look to dive him, if you can get him to waste his counterstrike before you are fully committed to the dive that is ideal. Look to kill him before he hits level 6, if you can call for jungle to help with the dive it is the best time to get assistance. Once he starts beating (when he scales) you focus more on shoving waves and moving from lane into potentially some roams (or jungle camp farm). Use your extra mobility to your advantage. Late game you lose hard on the split (unless u built a massive lead), but can still match him under turret. Try to force on the enemy team with a flank before jax gets setup on the split push.

Lethal tempo is VERY broken and can allow some silly allins with ghost if he pushes to far forward. However after level 1 your kill opportunities diminish and it will become mostly a farm matchup where you are trying to stay healthy enough to support your jungler if he decides to gank for you. Tips to avoid damage, 1. When farming under turret while he is pressuring you, you do not have to go for every single minion. If you have taken too much damage usually you do not want to go for the ranged minions because they are closer to the Jayce that is pressuring you and Jayce can deal a lot more damage to you going for ranged minions then he can while you are hitting the melees. Post 6 when you have a good amount of fury and hp if he overextends in the lane against you, you can run him down with your ghost + flash and win in a single all in. You do not want to take short trades against Jayce you only want to all in and thats it. Every allin you take against Jayce have your ghost up or you can get bursted and kited. In the mid-late game you will win allins vs Jayce in the 1v1 even when diving as long as you have ghost up and he doesnt have flash advantage on you, as long as you can stick on him. In the ultra late game jayce can start winning with items like GA to prevent you from full on all-inning him and he tends to one shot and kite effectively.

The travel time on that 3rd q is pretty slow early on in the game and is very easily dodgeable just look to sidestep it. Only take extended trades vs this matchup, doing anything else will result in a net win for K'sante. Post level 6 be careful when near K'sante's turret if you aren't in a position to dive him as he can knock you back a very far range back into his turret (even through walls) with his 3rd q into w into ultimate combo. It is very important if you end up looking for an allin post 6 that you have ghost up or have the means to chase him down through his high mobility post ult or you will get kited hard, so either have spin available, ghost, and or flash ready for the allin.

Karthus players will usually try to use their q to hit you when you walk up for minions to try and guarantee the damage.

Look to dodge his q's while you build up fury level one and if you dodge enough you can look for trades level 1 and level 2 assuming that you get level 2 first. IMPORTANT NOTE: When Kled dismounts, he gains courage for every auto attack on a champion, he gains courage for every last hit he gets, and he gets courage for hitting his dismounted q against you. So if you are looking to all in Kled MAKE SURE that you dismount him WITHOUT having to use ignite or your spin that way you can kill him immediately after the dismount. If you dismount him without having the ability to kill him immediately that is a mistake. Kled gets a lot of hp back when he remounts after he gets to 100 courage, so if you dismount him and cant kill him off his mount you basically just gave him at 300-400 hp potion. A strategy I employ if I can against kled is that I will look for short trades against kled and leave his mount at about 5-10% hp that way I can dismount him easily whenever I want and all in him right after. One thing to mention about kled's w is that he cannot control when he uses it EXCEPT for the first time he levels it up. Most good kled's will not level up their w (the 4 really fast auto attacks) until they are dismounted for the first time so that they can try to cheese a kill with the remount. So again make sure that if a kled is employing that strategy that you have enough damage to burst him so he cant remount during the allin. After kled has leveled up their W what they will do against Tryndamere is they will use their q and tiamat to farm so they can keep their w up and available to dash on you for an all in trade. If Kled ever uses his W on a minion, you have a 14 second cooldown on his level 1 w to look for a solid trade. In the mid-late game you outscale Kled really hard and can even 100-0 him under his turret once you are 4-5 items.

Avoid damage using the brushes top lane as well as potentially giving up minions of gold so you can collect more exp and sustain up with Q. Pre6 if she w's into you for a trade her W has a 18 second cooldown level 1 where you can potentially get a good trade in. For the most part you are going to be looking to farm this lane out because she does a very good job of kiting away from you. Before her first back though if she starts running out of mana because she is trying so hard to push you out of lane, then try to keep her from backing. The longer the lane goes without either of you two backing is beneficial for you since she needs damage and mana on her first back to pressure you harder.In the mid-late game splitpush Leblanc can handle Tryndamere in the 1v1 even while underleveled and underfarmed. If you find yourself having to 1v1 against a leblanc, look to shove her in and try to outrotate her. Leblanc doesnt have the best waveclear so she might be slow to respond.",

A lot of malphite players are doing the Q max arcane comet build with biscuit delivery to have maximum poke against you in lane so we need that extra sustain from this runeset and dorans shield to sustain. A big part of malphite whether he goes the grasp full tank build or a ap bruiser build is that they need mana to poke you down and to farm. If you are able to outsustain a malphite's mana pool you can make them miss a lot of farm. Also, if you keep them pushed in they will use mana to farm as well. When you have malphite pushed under turret it is essential when you are in a position where you can pressure him that you use the auto + spin out trade under turret for harass as well as getting autos on his turret (past 5 minutes.) Once malphite gets his first back for an item, see what he gets. You have to look for kills and snowball this matchup, so force long extended trades. If he gets mana like a glacial shroud you have to be more patient, but if he buys something like a bamis cinder or chain vest then try to do more to burn down his mana pool. Once he has used his mana to try to chunk you down (and you keep sustaining back up) then you can look for bigger trades and maybe even a dive with your ignite. In the mid-late game against malphite a lot of times you won't have the damage to kill him if hes building full armor like most malphite players do or unless you are extremely far ahead of him, so what you need to do is shove in the lane and force him to collect the farm on the split, then you out rotate him and flank his team (if there is an opportunity to) before he can match your rotation.

A couple of tips to take advantage of malzahar: Look for trades if he summons his voidlings and puts his space aids on the wave, he cant get his voidlings to attack you if they are already focusing the wave. Something that may stop you from going all in and killing malzahar is his passive shield. Your w when you hit the slow can actually get rid of the shield though and his shield has a long cooldown (30 second cooldown before level 6) Once his shield is down, wait for your w to come back up then you can look to pressure him. Malzahar is an immobile champion so if you can get the wave on your side of the lane you can use the extra room to run him down as well. Post level 6 you have to be careful about jungle pressure because malzahar has one of the best setups for a jungler to gank for him. Buying QSS later in the game can get rid of the suppression on his ultimate.

Make sure that if you are doing an extended trade that you move your character in between auto attacks to stay between maokai and his escape path (usually his turret.) Maokai wants to take short trades with you, but Tryndamere wants the long trades. So make sure when you pressure him that you are manipulating your wave so that it is in a position where you have plenty of room to run him down. When you dive a Maokai after getting him low enough, make sure that you save your spin to stick onto him rather then just for damage. Always start a dive off with an auto attack if its possible that way you can save your spin to better stick onto your opponent.

If its later in the game and mordekaiser doesnt have his shield stacked (the white bar isn't filled) thats a great time to look for an allin.

Here is my general strategy against Nasus, Look to pressure hard level 1 and 2 with an extended trade, always start trades off with an auto attack when he goes up to farm a minion. Get level 2 advantage first. Get the second wave completely into turret before the third wave comes up so that the enemy minion wave can \"\"bounce\"\" towards you (aka push towards you.) Then only last hit at the last possible second while it pushes towards you, this makes it so you hold a freeze against him. Don't let the minion wave get too big so make sure to kill a few minions but still leave it shoving towards you. Try to hit level 4 around the same time as nasus, once you are level 4 as long as you didnt take too much damage holding the position of the wave close to your turret you can look for an allin yourself OR you can set up easy ganks for your jungler. Be looking to always set up ganks/dives for your jungler to easily take.

Most of the time I will swap with my mid laner rather then face this matchup. (midlaners usually are ranged and can deal with something like Neeko a little bit better) If you have 40 CS at 10 min against Neeko that will be about average. Not everything is horrible though, there are some ways we can get a kill on her in lane. If she uses her snare and misses and we have a good amount of hp and fury that will be a good time to look for an allin. If you hit your w slow before spinning on Neeko and Neeko uses clone, the chicken effect will be on both the actual Neeko and the clone however the real Neeko will be slower which can giveaway which Neeko is the right one.

Nilah is very weak in the 1v1 early game with short range and her one advantage is having a duo partner to share bonus experience with which in top lane doesn't do anything. You beat her really hard as soon as you hit level 2 powerspike so look to stack up fury early and look for big trades. Nilah's W gives her evasion which dodges your auto attacks for a short time so make sure when that is on that you focus on staying on top of her rather then sitting still and auto attacking. Nilah can dash with 2 charges on it but her cooldown on the charges is extremely high so you can abuse that cooldown. She can dash towards enemies or allies with this ability. Her ultimate sucks you in and deals damage but not very much and is more for teamfights rather than 1v1. You can beat Nilah all game long in duels in the 1v1 on sidelane so look to abuse that. ",

The biggest part about the Olaf matchup is to get him to throw axes at you while you are sitting in your minion wave so that he shoves into you. Having the wave pushing towards Olaf is typically bad. Olaf has really good all in with the axes and he can potentially just run you down the lane if he hits more then 1 in a row. At level 4 you do have opportunities to trade/allin the olaf assuming you kept your health pool pretty high. A big opportunity to all in Olaf is if he throws an axe pretty far away from himself, if you spin on him and look to all in, he cant run towards his axe to reset his q cooldown which gives you a great advantage. You can also take advantage of his W cooldown which gives him a big shield so look for trades if he wastes his w. Post 6 you start to outscale Olaf, your ultimate is much better then his for the 1v1.

She is a tough lane bully to play against and in the mid-late game she can deny you from getting onto carries with her W which stops dashes (including your spin.) Her E can knock you back and if you get hit into a wall it deals double damage and stuns you. She is close to impossible to dive unless you got her low before hand. She gains a large shield with her passive auto attack on a 16 second cooldown (you can stop her from getting the shield if you step on the buckler that appears on the ground.) Very early levels though, usually just level 1-2 is your one chance to look for an advantage against her solo. Look to use and abuse heavy trades after building fury on the wave to get good trades into her. Poppy is tanky but does not have sustain. Her q deals 2 ticks of damage so make sure that if she hits her q on you that you side step the 2nd instance of damage. When trading with Poppy or if she is shoving you in, try to avoid being close to walls (when farming under turret make sure to not give her too big of an opening for her to slam you into your own turret.) In the mid-late game against Poppy assuming that you are even in gold with her, you can win allins when she is shoved deep into your side of the lane (after you are 4 items or more), but it is pretty much impossible to dive a poppy.

To beat Quinn consistently, farm up for a bit of damage + tier 2 boots (you can wait for full galeforce completion too), use ghost to force Quinn's e then follow up on her with your spin, when she flashes you follow up with flash. One tip against Quinn that is useful is regarding her E cooldown. Quinn and Tryndamere's E cooldowns are both 12 seconds level 1, however tryndamere can lower the cooldown of his spin with crits on champions or minions. So if you spin on quinn, crit her, then she e's away from example, that means you have atleast a 2 second window for another really good trade into her when your spin comes back up, and the window can get larger if you go back after trading and crit some minions to lower the cooldown of your spin even more. In the mid-late game you will win the 1v1 against quinn because of your ghost + flash and ability to stick onto her with your spin cooldown. One exception to this is maybe something like glacial augment quinn with blade of the ruined king ghost blade cleaver or something ridiculous that makes her able to fight you (but then it also makes her useless in literally every other situation.)

As far as deciding between ghost or ignite, be honest with yourself. Are the riven players at your elo kiting you enough to the point you need the ghost? Or can you get successful allins because they waste their cooldowns going into you so you can use nimbus cloak from ignite to stick to them. Tryndamere is stronger then riven in level 1 and level 2 allins (as long as riven doesnt have ignite), BUT only when you play it well. You want to build up fury before engaging a trade versus Riven and you want to avoid taking small trade damage while building up fury, once you have built over 25% fury is usually when you can be aggressive and look for a trade. Riven players that know the matchup will typically play back after you have built up fury so what you want to do is get level 2 advantage by pushing in the wave and then pushing the second wave completely into turret so that the wave \"\"bounces\"\" back to you (pushes back towards you.) If you couldn't find a good trade into riven on the first two waves just play back and safe until the wave crashes back into your turret. You can walk up and auto minions as its pushing back to you, but if she looks to trade then just walk up and spin away from the minion (while killing it to get the farm.) In this matchup you want to make sure you are always trading with minion advantage and that you are in a good position in lane to force an extended trade. Riven will win all short trades (played correctly) so Tryndamere must look for extended trades. On Riven's first back she will most likely pick up a CDR item which will allow her to extend her Q. What extending her q means, is that if she uses her Q, and waits till the very last second to use her 2nd and third q's then she can go instantly right into another set of q's. This is very powerful against tryndamere and will provide really good burst and/or allow her to disengage after trading. Spots where Tryndamere can punish Riven is purely how the Riven player uses her cooldowns. If she does not extend her q enough then there will be a longer cooldown until she can use her set of 3 dashes again. If you notice riven use her w or e without it being a trade on you, you can look for a trade. Every trade you must be willing to all in with ghost if you see an opportunity to run her down. In the mid-late game duels against Riven are all about if you can stick onto her and force the allin, and the way Riven wants to win is by bursting you to force your ultimate then kite away. Tryndamere's Ghost + CDR will help him all in a riven but must pick a good spot preferably with rageblade stacked as well as full fury and ghost ready. If you are winning against Riven look to pressure her hard, and potentially look for dives under her turret. If you are losing, look to push out waves and rotate to other waves, jungle camps, or flank opportunities.\"",

Post level 6 Tryndamere gets his ulti which will allow him more spots to beat up on Rumble, but a good rumble player will know how to keep tryndamere too low to look for an allin. If the enemy team has a lot of slows, swifty boots are a great option for sticking onto rumble in the 1v1 because of his big slows on his harpoons and ultimate. If you feel like you are sticking onto the rumble pretty well though you can just run berzerker greaves. If enemy team is heavy magic damage then merc treads is also a good option. Tryndamere outscales rumble in the mid-late game heavily in the 1v1, rumble's only hope is to hug turret and try to kite out a dive or to group with his team and force a play before Tryndamere can pressure.",

        "WHAT TO DO": "Lethal Tempo Runes and Build. Ignite + Flash. Dorans shield start. Ryze has really good poke early but since his W is no longer a root (unless he empowers it with his E first) tryndamere can get really strong trades against him. In the early game, ryze is very squishy and tryndamere can take advantage of that for some strong trades especially level 1 and 2. Try to punish ryze before he can go back and grab tear. Do not use your w slow on ryze until his phase rush is on cooldown because it would just be a wasted animation. Ryze has really good waveclear and damage once he completes his tear and can do very well in trades vs you. Once you get tiamat and tier two boots (can go zerkers or merc treads) you can typically have good trades into ryze. In the mid-late game splitting against Ryze can be difficult because his burst is very high as well as having good kiting between his movespeed from his passive as well as phase rush. You need to try and bait out his phase rush without burning ultimate, and when his phase rush is down you can look for a solid trade. Or if you have 100% crit and 40% cdr you can spin auto attack twice and reset your spin again to catch up to him on his phase rush activation. Pick your spots against Ryze well, make sure you are fighting him with your fury stacked, if you try to greed an allin without having full fury he can kite you very easily.",

In the 1v1 you should have no issue beating her at any stage in the game just dont let her get too much poke on you before you get enough fury level one. Post level 6 if she stacks up enough on you she can cast her ultimate on a 3 second cooldown that does decent damage but most of the time u can just ignore it press r and kill her.

Be very careful about his sword positioning, if he pulls it through you he can get a lot of extra bonus damage and attack speed against you for a solid trade. You can start looking for allin trades with shen around level 4 (unless he wastes his q level 1 and 2 for farm instead of using it to trade with you.) When fighting against Shen what he will do is use his q, block auto attacks with his W and then taunt through you back to his turret, so in this matchup when you are going for an allin DO NOT position between Shen and his escape path if you dont think 100% sure you are killing him. If you put yourself between Shen and his escape path he can taunt through you dealing extra damage and disengaging from you. This will save you extra hp on each trade. At level 6 is when Tryndamere can start to really dominate Shen. Shen gets an ultimate which is USELESS for a 1v1 and Tryndamere gets 5 seconds of being unkillable. You can run tiamat with lethal tempo build in this matchup if you would like to put some extra pressure on Shen and his turret. One tip about Shen's W is that it blocks auto attacks but only on himself and other champions so if there are minions around shen when he W's and you have tiamat you can actually hit the minions or use your tiamat active and still damage him. If you are looking to dive Shen, try to bait him into taunting you under turret, this saves you from having to chase him down through his dash away from you, also puts him right on top of you and you start the dive with an auto attack which is what you want. Before you look to dive Shen, make sure you \"\"prepare\"\" him by taking short trades with auto attack + spin out (while dealing the spin damage on the way out.) In the mid-late game splitpush you outscale Shen in the 1v1, but it can be hard to dive him effectively because of how tanky he gets. Make sure that every time you shove Shen in that you are doing 1 of these 3 things, make sure you are looking for trade damage on Shen, make sure you set up deep vision to protect you on the splitpush, and make sure you look to take enemy jungle camps when you can. You can get leads on Shen in the splitpush without killing him, but always look to pressure him first. If his team is closeby and you dont wanna risk getting caught out just place some wards or take some neutrals.

        "WHAT TO DO": "Ghost + Flash. Dorans blade. There are two types of singed players, singed players who go for laning dominance with ignite + an aggressive keystone and others  who will go ghost + flash + phase rush to try and survive. Against a singed player who is going for a lane dominance build, you don't have to play too aggressive, look for spots where you have high health and fury and he is on your side of the lane for a potential all in, or you can just sit back and farm and wait to outscale him in the mid game. Against a singed with phase rush look to be very aggressive with him especially level 1 and try to punish him before he can even use his keystone.  Something a singed might do is proxy your wave behind you. If your jungler is around or mid laner is willing to rotate you can look for a free kill on him, or you can go and proxy singed's wave and ALSO take his jungler's camps. If singed tries to proxy you level 1, make sure you walk with your wave all the way to lane and if the enemy singed is there run him down and burn his summs and look to kill him if you can. Here is a clip to counter proxy singed https://clips.twitch.tv/TenuousBlatantCattleRalpherZ-VO3tnlwfilILxzDc . If you are playing against a proxy singed then look to just farm absolutely everything (including enemy jungle camps) . One tip against singed if he looks to do the goo + flip combo, look to back off of singed before he flips.  There is a small delay when he is casting goo that you can back off the trade before he flips.

Level one build up a little bit of fury and look for a big trade (dodge his q!) and typically you can get a good amount of damage on him, get level 2 power spike and look for an allin. If sion plays it safe get the first two waves into turret and let the wave \"\"bounce\"\" back towards you (minion waves crash all the way into turret then it starts pushing back towards you.) One tip against sion players is that you have to watch out for his 2 cheeses. He can cheese your buff level 1 by late invading into killing himself on the buff then taking it with his passive. Another cheese a sion player will do is wait in the second brush top lane and full charge a Q from the brush to get the first 3 minions and deal a lot of damage to you. If you avoid being cheesed by both of those and are able to play the matchup straight up you should win the early laning phase. Whether you snowball against sion or not depends on how well you can extend a trade, and how well you can manipulate the minion wave to set up proper allins using the length of the lane to run him down (basically look to have the wave on your side of the lane.) Make sure every time you kill Sion that you run away immediately so that you dont die to his passive. A lot of this matchup as well is dodging his q so make sure while you are trading with him that you sidestep his knockup. Also after level 6, make sure that you are in between sion and his escape path so the he cant ult away from you during the all in.

        "WHAT TO DO": "Ghost + Flash. Dorans shield. MERC TREADS (or go tenacity rune) The most consistent way to beat teemo is to look for an early all in and get level 2 before teemo. Look to avoid damage in any way possible so make sure that you position well against him either by hiding in the brush while waiting for minions to farm or hanging back behind your ranged minions. If teemo tries to harass you make sure you stand within your minion wave then kite back so that he takes minion damage. A good tip against teemo when you do trade against him is that teemo's blind affects your autos THE INSTANT YOU START THE ANIMATION not when you finish the auto. So while you are blinded pay attention to the white CC bar under your resource bars to see when his blind will run out, keep on top of teemo and don't auto attack until the white bar has COMPLETELY elapsed. If you are in a position where he is slowpushing into your turret be careful about going after the ranged minions (they are worth less gold then melee) teemo can hit you without taking turret shots when you walk up for ranged minions but he will take a turret shot if you auto melee minions hitting the turret from max melee distance. If you skip out on last hitting a few ranged minions and keep your health high you might be able to setup a big trade or even an allin if he is still up against your turret when all the minions are almost gone.  Hitting your W slow against Teemo can be difficult cause he can turn back to throw his blind or auto attack.  My advice is when you spin for the all in, wait until after his blind + auto to use your W slow. Or if you want to play it safe you can run at teemo to try to force him to turn his back to you and W slow him before you spin in. In the mid-late game split push against Teemo you do outscale him as long as you didnt let him get ahead of you. If you stay atleast even you should win all ins, just make sure you hit that W slow or he can punish you really hard! Updated 1/27/2024",

If Trundle is chasing you down try just walking away from him and save your spin for when he pillars you. A good time to take a trade with trundle is when his W is on cooldown. His W gives him increased healing, movement speed, and a bunch of attack speed.

When wukong clones, make sure to keep a timer on it in your head because it is a 20 second cooldown early on. Sometimes you can punish his clone being down if he walks back up to you while its still on cooldown. If you don't get an advantage in lane be careful for when he hits his blade of the ruined king spike. He can force a trade on you if you are overextended and 100-0 you without you being able to fight back effectively. In the mid-game if you are behind, just look to farm up and play away from wukong. By late game you will have enough damage to all in him, if he itemizes deaths dance and blade of the ruined king make sure you get executioners.",

Tips against dueling Xayah: Look to sidestep the angle of her feathers, don't just run in a straight line against her, xayah pulls back feathers towards her always, so for instance if xayah ultis, try to get behind her so that you are not in between xayah and her feathers. If pulls her feathers back and hits you with 3 or more you get rooted. If you can manipulate the wave so it is on your side of the lane, it can be easier to setup allins on xayah. In the mid-late game xayah can be annoying to duel but if you hit your w slow you will win most of the time vs her.

        "WHAT TO DO": "Lethal Tempo Runes and Build. Ignite + Flash Long sword refillable potion start. Lethal tempo can sometimes be ineffective against yasuo because of how well he can kite away from auto attacks in your minion wave however if you catch him away from your minion wave or he stays in your auto range too long this is they better keystone to take. If you can build up fury without taking too much damage level one you can look to get level 2 advantage and take a good trade. To avoid damage from yasuo's q walk inside his q range, then instantly right back out to bait out his q and dodge it. If you are looking for a trade against yasuo, first try to take away his shield by damaging him with an auto attack, then engage on him after the shield expires. Yasuo has very strong level 1 and 2 allins, so if you take too much damage level 1 building up fury, let him push you in, sustain back up so you can fight him when you hit level 4. After level 6, Tryndamere can win an allin with yasuo by sticking on to him, after he uses ultimate, Yasuo must look to try to kite with his knockup and dashing through your minions. It is always best to fight Yasuo away from your minion wave.Typically post 6 if you are able to engage on him and dodge his tornado in the all in you will win by default because he cannot ulti. In the mid-late game you can win against yasuo away from minions although in your minion wave if he is even with you, he can fight you well. Once Yasuo is 6 items it becomes a very even 1v1 even away from minions.",

        "WHAT TO DO": "Yone much like Yasuo is very strong with his attacks and abilities level 1 and 2 because of his auto attack reset mechanic with his q and that he can build up to a knockup. Early levels you are looking to avoid yone's q typically by baiting it out by walking in its range and then walking right back out. In between his q cooldown early levels if he doesnt have it stacked up you can take trades, if you get crits you can even all in him early on. Once Yone gets his e the matchup becomes a bit tricky. Its hard to commit to yone because he will use his E when you go in and kite out your lethal tempo proc which then he can fight you after its over. However if Yone uses his e just know that he eventually has to go back to the spot he e'd from so in some cases you can just wait by his soul where he will go back to. So don't over commit into an allin vs Yone while he has his E up. His E has a 22 second cooldown level 1, and then its reduced by 3 seconds each point he puts into it. When looking to dive Yone try to deal damage to bait out his e, then spin out of turret range if you can't commit so you dont have to burn ulti, then redive with your ultimate while his e is down. Yone's R can be used as a blink to get away but it has a long cast time in which time you can step in front of where he is trying to ulti so he doesnt dash as far away. This matchup is very snowbally and its usually whoever gets the first kill will win however even when you are ahead as Tryndamere vs this matchup he can still outplay using his knockup from his q and his E so dont get baited into overcommitting. Later in the game you can win 1v1's typically by sidestepping q's while autoattacking so he doesnt build up his tornado quickly and using ghost to run him down.",

You want extended trades vs yorick, look to start every trade with an auto attack so you can save your spin to extend the trade. Yorick's wall has a 20 second cooldown level 1. Trades that yorick wants to take against you is ones where he can trap you in his wall and hit his e with ghouls up. Trades you want are ones that you are able to stick onto yorick even after he casts his wall (if you are able to save your spin to get out of his wall that is perfect.) Yorick is very strong at level 6 with his maiden up, but if you are able to kill his maiden or kill yorick his ultimate has a VERY long cooldown (160 seconds level 1.) The more yorick E's you can avoid in this lane to prevent his ghouls from harassing you, the higher chance you have of winning against him. In the mid-late game Tryndamere outscales Yorick heavily in the 1v1 as long as you can manage to stick to yorick. Critting yorick's wall reduces your spin cooldown. ",

Your sustained damage is better, zed is looking to burst you and kite, so if you can manage a w slow and engage on him with his w down that is your ideal fight. Post level 6, zed has multiple ways of kiting you, but if you are able to absorb his ultimate without using your ultimate that leaves you with a huge advantage. Try to keep your health high at all times in the lane so that he cannot get his passive on you (while below 50% hp zed deals bonus damage to you with an auto attack.) Splitting against zed in the mid-late game can be difficult, if he can one shot your hp bar and kite you dont look to fight him. Look to shove in, force him to rotate towards your lane, then rotate away towards jungle camps, placing wards, or looking to swap lanes or flank the enemy team. Late game against zed if you need to 1v1 him in order to win the game, buy a randuins and he wont be able to one shot you from 100-0 to burn your ultimate meaning he will have to stay on you longer to commit more damage giving you room to get your all in damage in before he can kite you.
